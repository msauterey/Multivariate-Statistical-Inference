# Multivariate-Statistical-Inference

This course is concerned with statistical analysis of data sets containing multiple observations on each subject. We begin with a review of basic results from matrix
algebra, and develop some probability theory for random vectors and matrices. The multivariate normal, Wishart, and Hotelling's T2 distributions provide the foundation for inference
about mean vectors and covariance matrices. We then move on to exploratory and inferential multivariate methods including: principal component analysis, canonical correlation, factor
analysis, discrimination and classification, clustering, and multidimensional scaling. The emphasis throughout will be on the application of statistical methods to real data.

The required text is Applied Multivariate Statistical Analysis, fourth edition; by Wolfgang Härdle and Léopold Simar. The course will cover material from Chapters 2-7 and 10-17.
